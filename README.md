# üìã Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing hotel booking cancellations using a dataset of over 119,000 observations from City and Resort Hotels between July 2015 and August 2017. The goal was to uncover trends behind cancellations and provide insights to help the hotel industry make smarter, data-driven decisions. Data set was found on Kaggle

# ‚ú® Key Notes:
- Tools used: **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Analyzed 119K+ hotel booking records to identify key trends in cancellations and provide actionable insights to improve revenue and customer retention (data set was found on Kaggle) 
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Pandas, handled missing values and outliers for accuracy.
- Performed **(Exploratory Data Analysis) EDA and data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and support recommendations.
- Identified peak cancellation months and top contributing countries; showed that cancellations increased with price, especially at City Hotels.
- Computed average occupancy rates by room type and city, analyzed monthly revenue trends and market profitability.
Delivered strategic recommendations for pricing, marketing, and customer experience improvements to reduce cancellations and boost revenue.

# üìë Problem Statement & Hypothesis:
City and Resort Hotels have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to lost revenue. The hypothesis was that factors like pricing, seasonality, and booking methods (e.g., online travel agents) could contribute to these cancellations.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques:
The project was executed using Python in the Jupyter Notebook. Data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas, and Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize data and reveal trends.

# üìä Data Analysis & Insights:
The analysis showed that cancellation rates increased with booking price, especially in City Hotels. Seasonal trends were identified, with January showing high cancellations possibly due to post-holiday competition amongst hotels. Certain countries, such as Portugal, had higher cancellation rates, suggesting the need to improve customer satisfaction (i.e investing in quality services) for those demographics.

# üìà Business Impact:
Insights included suggestions for pricing adjustments, seasonal marketing strategies, and enhancing services for high-risk markets. The project demonstrated the importance of data-driven decisions in reducing cancellations, improving occupancy rates, and increasing overall revenue in the hospitality sector.

# üöÄ Summary
Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed 119K+ hotel bookings to uncover key cancellation trends. I cleaned and transformed data, conducted exploratory data analysis and visualizations, and identified higher cancellations linked to price, seasonality, and location, providing recommendations to improve revenue and retention.
